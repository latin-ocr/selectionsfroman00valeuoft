Valerius were written not so much to be read as to
point the moral of orations meant ‘to split the ears
of the groundlings.' To attain this end, he is con-

poetical words and phrases, and forges the most
audacious metaphors 3 he often descende to the
mereat trivialities, and applies the most far-setched
epithetS. He cannot, however, be aecused of sacri-
fieing in any way either his clearness or his simplicity.

He was more industrious than critical ; but notwith-
standing his historical inaccuraeies-such as making
Tanaquil the wife of Ancus MarciuS‚ mistaking
Aeschylus sor PericIvS, and confusing the Scipios
with the Catos-in his stories he generally hits the
mark by quoting not inapt illustratione of his theme ;
and certainly much of the information which he gives
is to be obtained from no other source.

He has neither the brevity nor the sul-»tle penetra-
tion of Tacitu83 nor does he possess the polish mul
fine tante of Quintilian. So ‹lispleasvd inde‘ed was
Erasmus with his tricks of assectation that he wne.
constrained to utter the scathing remark· that Valerius
is no more like Cicero than a mulo is like· a inan.
