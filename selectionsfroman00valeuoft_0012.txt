viii VALERIUS MAXIMUS.

research, it is to be inferred that he was a professor
of rhetoric.

His Anecdotes, which he dedicates to the Emperor
Tiberius (A.D. 14-37), consist of nine bookS, entitled
Facta et Dicta Memorabilia, or Memorable Doinqs and
Sayinys, and are intended to illustrate certain moral
qualities, virtues, vices, merits, and demeritS. They
are for the most part short stories from Roman
history 3 but the records of other nations have
supplied many additional examples. His principal
authorities were Cicero, Livy, Sallust, Varro, Asinius
Pollio, Herodotus, Alexander Polyhistor, and Xeno-
phon Lampsacenus, the author of the Periplus.

The literary style of Valerius was in a great
measure influenced by the politica] and social tend-
encies of his times, It was the age of rhetoric, when
none but the glib talker had any chance of success
in public life. Much of the political success of
Tiberius himself was due to his oratory, and to that
â€˜precision' of language on which he prided himself so
much. On the other hand, his nephew Drusus, when
despatched by the Emperor to Pannonia to quell a
mutiny of the legions, experienced great difficulty in
calming the angry passions of the seditious soldiers
