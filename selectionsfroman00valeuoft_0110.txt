Cn. Pompeium: Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus was the son of
Pompeius Strabo. At the age of twenty-three he espoused
the cause of the Optimates, aud after defeating Sertorius and
Mithridates, and setting in order the Provinces of Rome in the
East, he became one of the members of the First Triumvirate
(see note on M. Crassus, ἓ ll). The death of Julia, daughter
of Julius Caesar, whom Pompeius had married, and the defeat
and death of M. Crassus, broke up the alliance between
Caesar and Pompeius. A civil war lasting from ΒΑΕ. 51 to 48
ended in Caesar’s favour. After the battle of Pharsalia
